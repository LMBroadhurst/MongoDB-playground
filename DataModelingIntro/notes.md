## Data Modelling
- Process of defining how data is stored, and how data is related to other data

Questions to ask?
- What does my applciation do
- What data will I store
- How will users access this data
- What data will be most valuable to me

Good data modal:
- easier to manage data
- more efficient queries
- reduce memory/CPU
- reduces costs

#### Data that is accessed together should be stored together
#### Documents are schema flexible

## Normalising data => moving to SQL?
