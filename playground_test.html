To install the MongoDB VS Code extension, let's open up VS Code and navigate to the Extensions tab. Type in MongoDB and select MongoDB for VS Code and click Install. Once the extension has been successfully installed, a leaf icon will appear on the left sidebar.\n\nLet's click on it. Here we can see the interface for the MongoDB extension, which has three sections, connections, playgrounds, and help and feedback. Next, let's establish a connection to an existing MongoDB deployment by clicking the Add connection button. A new tab opens that gives us two options to connect.\n\nWe can connect with a connection string, or use advanced connection settings. Clicking on the advanced connection settings will open up a new window where we can enter a specific connection information for a MongoDB deployment. For this example, I'll use the connection string for my existing MongoDB Atlas deployment. Back on the connection tab.\n\nI will click on the Connect with connection string button, which will prompt us to enter a connection string. Make sure that network access to the Atlas cluster is set up or the connection will fail. We should now see your connection pop up in the Connections tab of the extension. But did you notice something?\n\nThat's right we received an authentication error in the bottom right corner of our IDE. I forgot to update the credentials for my Atlas connection string. Let's go ahead and remove the incorrect connection string and add the correct one. I'll right click on our Atlas cluster in VS Code.\n\nHere we can see a list of options we can use, like remove connection. Once selected, it will prompt us asking if we're sure we want to remove the connection. Now I'll paste in my connection string again but this time with the correct credentials. After pressing Enter, we see a green leaf signifying we have successfully connected.\n\nNow that we've established a connection to our Atlas cluster, let's rename it to something more identifiable. Right click on the connection and select Rename connection. Next, we'll be prompted to enter a new name. In this case, I'm going to name it development cluster.\n\nOnce complete, we should see our newly named cluster in the connection tab. We can now interact with our Atlas cluster from VS Code. We can also easily disconnect from our cluster when we're done using it. I'll right click on our Atlas cluster in VS Code and select disconnect.\n\nOnce complete, we should see our connection turn gray. Great work. In this video, we learned that the MongoDB VS Code extension allows us to connect to a MongoDB deployment and explore our data. We saw how to install the MongoDB VS Code extension and how to connect to an Atlas cluster.\n\nFinally, we looked at how to remove and rename a connection, as well as disconnect from a cluster.","hasPart":[]}</script><script class="w-json-ld" type="application/ld+json" id="w-json-ldwistia_220">{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@id":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/ofz8sehyog","@type":"VideoObject","duration":"PT3M24S","name":"Exploring MongoDB Data within VSCode","thumbnailUrl":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/b17fb50b3595c35c774b2d74c164c77b.jpg?image_crop_resized=1280x720","embedUrl":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/ofz8sehyog","uploadDate":"2023-09-21","description":"a MongoDB VSCode Extension video","contentUrl":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/3943ac52e5f6b137f1d83441c7e946fe8fdeb8e7.m3u8","transcript":"[MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nWith the MongoDB VS Code extension installed and connect it to our MongoDB deployment, we can now begin exploring our data within VS Code. In this video, we'll learn how to navigate your databases and collections using the MongoDB VS Code extension. We'll also edit documents and launch the MongoDB Shell from the extension. When we click on the connection, it'll expand to show us the databases.\n\nWe have four databases: admin, config, local, and sample training. When I click on Sample training, our menu expands to show us the collections inside the database. Let's click on a particular collection. And we can see three more entries named documents, schema and indexes.\n\nLet's take a moment to explore these. Documents shows a list of documents in the collection. The title of the document corresponds to the _id for that document. When I select the document from the list, it opens up a JSON file in a new window with data from the document.\n\nThe document view has syntax highlighting and formatting but can also be used to manipulate the document. Let's take a look at how to do that next. We'll update the class ID value by adding a zero. Don't forget to save your change.\n\nWe should see a confirmation message in the bottom right. Now our document is updated without having to launch a different tool or type out a command in the shell. We can confirm this update is applied by hovering over the Documents folder and clicking the Refresh button. MongoDB documents in a collection are polymorphic and can take on different shapes.\n\nThis can make it difficult to remember the structure of the documents. This is where the document schema view can help. Selecting the schema shows us the inferred structure of documents in this collection. Additionally, if a field exists in all documents and its type is consistent throughout the collection, we'll see an icon indicating that field's data type.\n\nFor example, both the class ID and student ID fields are numbers, so they're represented by the # icon. We can also hover over the field to see more information about it. Finally, let's have a look at the indexes in our collection. When we click here, we see a list of the indexes that have been created in our collection, such as the default _id index.\n\nIf I select a particular index we can see the order of the fields and how they're sorted. The up arrow represents ascending order while a down arrow represents descending. Some people prefer to use the MongoDB Shell to interact with their MongoDB deployments. We understand that, which is why we make it easy to launch the MongoDB Shell from within the IDE using the same connection information.\n\nLet's check it out. Let's right click on our Atlas cluster and VS Code. From the list of options, I'll select Launch MongoDB Shell. This opens a MongoDB Shell connected to our cluster inside VS Code.\n\nMongoDB Shell is a separate tool and must be installed on the system for this feature to operate. Awesome job. In this video, we learned how to navigate our data using the MongoDB extension. We looked at documents, schema and indexes.\n\nWe even modified documents in our collection directly from the IDE.

Wouldn't it be great to interact with the database without the need for a separate tool? The good news is that the MongoDB VS Code extension offers this powerful functionality in the form of playgrounds. In this video, we'll learn how to leverage this powerful feature.\n\nA playground is a reusable scripting environment for MongoDB. Just like the MongoDB Shell, it's based on JavaScript and can be used interactively. We can use playgrounds to prototype changes or to build a reusable script file for common tasks. Playgrounds provide syntax highlighting and intelligent autocomplete.\n\nIntelligent autocomplete is available for the MongoDB Shell API and operators, as well as database collection and field names. The possibilities for streamlining your development work with playgrounds are endless. Let's try it out. We begin by creating a playground.\n\nNavigate to the left sidebar of the MongoDB extension then click the Create New playground button. The Editor tab now contains a sample playground file. We can see that this auto generated playground contains syntax highlighting and many helpful comments to tell us what it's doing. Let's delete the contents of this template and start with a fresh canvas.\n\nFirst, we'll create a variable named database and give it a string value of inventory. We'll also create a variable named collection and give it a value of products. Next, let's switch to the database we want. Notice that when I type the letter U, my autocomplete prompts me with the function that I'm looking for.\n\nWe now have access to the inventory database with the DB variable and can create our collection. With our database and collection in place, let's test it. To run a playground select the Play button in the top right of VS Code. Once complete, a results window opens with the response from our database, we can also confirm this by refreshing our data and the extension.\n\nAs we can see, our new database and collection have been created. Don't forget to save smart and save often using your favorite IDE shortcut. In order for the MongoDB VS Code extension to interpret this file its name has to end with .MongoDB.js. I'm going to name this playground inventory.MongoDB.js\n\nand save it in a directory that I named VS Code. If we open our File Explorer, we'll see the newly saved playground file. Nice work. I'm sure you can already appreciate some of the advantages of using playgrounds.\n\nWe'll continue building out our playground in the upcoming lessons. In this video, we learned that a playground is a reusable scripting environment for MongoDB.","potentialAction":{"@type":"SeekToAction","target":"https://learn.mongodb.com/learn/course/mongodb-vscode-extension/lesson-3-introducing-playgrounds/first-lesson?client=customer&wtime={seek_to_second_number}","startOffset-input":"required name=seek_to_second_number"}}</script>
